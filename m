Usually the empty function fall into one of two classes:
  1. They return an error, so drivers will abort their initialization,
  2. They are a plain no-op, for functions with harmless side-effects.

The !MMU versions are not dummies, but assume a transparent translation.
This may lead to drivers continuing their initialization and crashing the
system.

Should these dependencies on HAS_IOMEM be changed to "HAS_IOMEM ||
COMPILE_TEST"?
