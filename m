Testing drivers, hardware and firmware within production kernels was the use
case that inspired KTF (Kernel Test Framework). Currently KTF is available as a
standalone git repository. That's been the most efficient form for us so far, 
as we typically want tests to be developed once but deployed on many different
kernel versions simultaneously, as part of continuous integration.

But we're also working towards a suitable proposal for how it can be 
smoothly integrated into the kernel, but while still keeping the benefits 
and tools to allow cross-kernel development of tests. As part of this,
I have a master student who has been looking at converting some of 
the existing kernel test suites to KTF, and we have more examples coming 
from our internal usage, as we get more mileage and more users.
See for instance this recent blog entry testing skbuff as an example,
on the Oracle kernel development blog:

It would certainly be interesting to see how the use cases you struggled with
would work with KTF ;-)

Thanks,
