You don't want to do that.

It's always been untrue but it's even more untrue nowdays. The tty layer
objects are refcounted, and the code has had significant rewrites. line.c
hidden away in uml hasn't been updated.

I added a comment about 3 years ago pointing out another older change
that was needed and that wasn't acted on either..

Take a look at how all the other tty drivers use tty_port, how the ioctls
have been supposed to work for the past few years and the callback
changes, then use them.

tty_port will actually do most of the hard work for you.
