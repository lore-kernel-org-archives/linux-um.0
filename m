I was wondering about that as well. But at least for code size on
m68k, this didn't have much impact.  Looking at the generated code,
the increase due to using code for the (few different) cases is offset
by a 16-bit jump table (which is to be credited to the compiler).

In terms of CPU cycles, it's indeed worse than before.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
