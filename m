Such as, for example, seriously broken handling of free_winch(): delaying
free_irq() until after return from IRQ handler is nice, but not enough -
freeing struct winch itself (or winch->stack, for that matter) is also best
left until after free_irq().  Normal way to do that is schedule_work()...
Fixed and pushed...

Folks, I don't know what to do with all that stuff; as far as I'm concerned
the ideal variant would be to have functioning git tree maintained by Richard.
Is that possible?  I can ask to start pulling um-header.git into linux-next,
but I would very much prefer to avoid that, TYVM...  If nothing else, ACK/NAK
on the stuff in there should be done by architecture maintainer(s).
