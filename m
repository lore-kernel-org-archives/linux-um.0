Not changing __state is better because it removes special cases
from the scheduler that only apply to ptrace.

We still need to change signal_wake_up in that case.  Possibly
signal_wake_up_state.  The choice is for fatal signals is TASK_WAKEKILL
suppressed or is TASK_TRACED added.

With removing TASK_WAKEKILL the resulting code behaves in a very obvious
minimally special case way.  Yes there is a special case in
signal_wake_up but that is the entirety of the special case and it is
easy to read and see what it does.

Let me describe his freezer change as that is much easier to get to the
final result.  RT has more problems as it turns all spin locks into
sleeping locks.  When a task is frozen it turns it's sleeping state into
TASK_FROZEN.  That is TASK_STOPPED and TASK_TRACED become TASK_FROZEN.
If this races with ptrace_check_attach the wait_task_inactive fail as
the process state has changed.  This makes the freezer userspace
visible.

For ordinary tasks the freezer thaws them just by giving them a spurious
wake-up.  After which they check their conditions and go back to sleep
on their on.  For TASK_STOPPED and TASK_TRACED (which can't handle
spurious wake-ups) the __state value is recovered from task->jobctl.

For RT cgroup_enter_frozen needs fixes that no one has proposed yet.
The problem is that for "preempt_disable()" before
"read_unlock(&tasklist_lock)" is not something that can reasonably be
removed.  It would cause a performance regression.

So my plan is to get the things as far as the Peter's freezer change
working.  That cleans up the code and makes it much closer for
ptrace working in PTREMPT_RT.  That makes the problems left for
the PREEMPT_RT folks much smaller.

The immediate problem the JOBCTL_PTRACE_SIGNR patch solves is:
- stopping in ptrace_report_syscall.
- Not having PT_TRACESYSGOOD set.
- The tracee being killed with a fatal signal
- The tracee sending SIGTRAP to itself.

The larger problem solved by the JOBCTL_PTRACE_SIGNR patch is that
it removes the need for current->ptrace test from ptrace_stop.  Which
in turn is part of what is needed for wait_task_inactive to be
guaranteed a stop in ptrace_stop.


Thinking about it.  I think a reasonable case can be made that it
is weird if not dangerous to play with the task fields (ptrace_message,
last_siginfo, and exit_code) without task_is_traced being true.
So I will adjust my patch to check that.  The difference in behavior
is explicit enough we can think about it easily.

Eric
