But why is it bad if the tracee doesn't sleep in schedule ? If it races
with SIGKILL. I still can't understand this.

Yes, wait_task_inactive() can fail, so you need to remove WARN_ON_ONCE()
in 11/12.

Why is removing TASK_WAKEKILL from TASK_TRACED and complicating
*signal_wake_up() better?

And even if we need to ensure the tracee will always block after
ptrace_freeze_traced(), we can change signal_pending_state() to
return false if JOBCTL_PTRACE_FROZEN. Much simpler, imo. But still
looks unnecessary to me.

OK, I guess this is what I do not understand. Could you spell please?

And speaking of RT, wait_task_inactive() still can fail because
cgroup_enter_frozen() takes css_set_lock? And it is called under
preempt_disable() ? I don't understand the plan :/

I didn't look at JOBCTL_PTRACE_SIGNR yet. But this looks minor to me,
I mean, I am not sure it worth the trouble.

Oleg.
