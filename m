I fully understand your point of view. COMPILE_TEST is a monster that
can do the heavy lifting for you, but monsters also have claws and fangs. ;-)

Having COMPILE_TEST having depend on !UML works for me. But don't
we have other archs without io mem? At least a few years ago while
porting nandsim to UML I found s390 that lacks of io mem too.

Maybe we depend COMPILE_TEST on HAS_IOMEM?
