Subject: [PATCH 2/9] um: cleanup Kconfig files

We can handle all not architecture specific UM configuration directly in
the newly added arch/um/Kconfig.  Do so by merging the Kconfig.common,
Kconfig.rest and Kconfig.um files into arch/um/Kconfig, and move the main
UML menu as well.

+	  This option gives you the ability to force a static link of UML.
+	  Normally, UML is linked as a shared binary.  This is inconvenient for
+	  use in a chroot jail.  So, if you intend to run UML inside a chroot,
+	  you probably want to say Y here.
+	  Additionally, this option enables using higher memory spaces (up to
+	  2.75G) for UML.

+	help
+          While the User-Mode Linux port uses its own root file system for
+          booting and normal file access, this module lets the UML user
+          access files stored on the host.  It does not require any
+          network connection between the Host and UML.  An example use of
+          this might be:
+
+          mount none /tmp/fromhost -t hostfs -o /tmp/umlshare
+
+          where /tmp/fromhost is an empty directory inside UML and
+          /tmp/umlshare is a directory on the host with files the UML user
+          wishes to access.
+
+          For more information, see
+          <http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/hostfs.html>.
+
+          If you'd like to be able to work with files stored on the host,
+          say Y or M here; otherwise say N.
+
+config MCONSOLE
+	bool "Management console"
+	depends on PROC_FS
+	default y
+	help
+          The user mode linux management console is a low-level interface to
+          the kernel, somewhat like the i386 SysRq interface.  Since there is
+          a full-blown operating system running under every user mode linux
+          instance, there is much greater flexibility possible than with the
+          SysRq mechanism.
+
+          If you answer 'Y' to this option, to use this feature, you need the
+          mconsole client (called uml_mconsole) which is present in CVS in
+          2.4.5-9um and later (path /tools/mconsole), and is also in the
+          distribution RPM package in 2.4.6 and later.
+
+          It is safe to say 'Y' here.
+
+config MAGIC_SYSRQ
+	bool "Magic SysRq key"
+	depends on MCONSOLE
+	help
+	  If you say Y here, you will have some control over the system even
+	  if the system crashes for example during kernel debugging (e.g., you
+	  will be able to flush the buffer cache to disk, reboot the system
+	  immediately or dump some status information). A key for each of the
+	  possible requests is provided.
+
+	  This is the feature normally accomplished by pressing a key
+	  while holding SysRq (Alt+PrintScreen).
+
+	  On UML, this is accomplished by sending a "sysrq" command with
+	  mconsole, followed by the letter for the requested command.
+
+	  The keys are documented in <file:Documentation/admin-guide/sysrq.rst>. Don't say Y
+	  unless you really know what this hack does.
+
+config KERNEL_STACK_ORDER
+	int "Kernel stack size order"
+	default 1 if 64BIT
+	range 1 10 if 64BIT
+	default 0 if !64BIT
+	help
+	  This option determines the size of UML kernel stacks.  They will
+	  be 1 << order pages.  The default is OK unless you're running Valgrind
+	  on UML, in which case, set this to 3.
+
+config MMAPPER
+	tristate "iomem emulation driver"
+	help
+	  This driver allows a host file to be used as emulated IO memory inside
+	  UML.
+
+config NO_DMA
+	def_bool y
+
+config PGTABLE_LEVELS

+	default 3 if 3_LEVEL_PGTABLES

+
+config SECCOMP
+	def_bool y
+	prompt "Enable seccomp to safely compute untrusted bytecode"
+	---help---
+	  This kernel feature is useful for number crunching applications
+	  that may need to compute untrusted bytecode during their
+	  execution. By using pipes or other transports made available to
+	  the process as file descriptors supporting the read/write
+	  syscalls, it's possible to isolate those applications in
+	  their own address space using seccomp. Once seccomp is
+	  enabled via prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP), it cannot be disabled
+	  and the task is only allowed to execute a few safe syscalls
+	  defined by each seccomp mode.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
