One of the more sensitive projects to changes around ptrace is rr
(Robert and Kyle added to CC). I ran rr's selftests before/after this
series and saw no changes. My failures remained the same; I assume
they're due to missing CPU features (pkeys) or build configs (bpf), etc:

99% tests passed, 19 tests failed out of 2777

Total Test time (real) = 773.40 sec

The following tests FAILED:
         42 - bpf_map (Failed)
         43 - bpf_map-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        414 - netfilter (Failed)
        415 - netfilter-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        454 - x86/pkeys (Failed)
        455 - x86/pkeys-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        1152 - ttyname (Failed)
        1153 - ttyname-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        1430 - bpf_map-32 (Failed)
        1431 - bpf_map-32-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        1502 - detach_sigkill-32 (Failed)
        1802 - netfilter-32 (Failed)
        1803 - netfilter-32-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        1842 - x86/pkeys-32 (Failed)
        1843 - x86/pkeys-32-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        2316 - crash_in_function-32 (Failed)
        2317 - crash_in_function-32-no-syscallbuf (Failed)
        2540 - ttyname-32 (Failed)
        2541 - ttyname-32-no-syscallbuf (Failed)

So, I guess:
