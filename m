I'm fine with either, thanks for the link. Mostly I want to make sure
other paths to gsmi_shutdown_reason() aren't also converted to a try.

The IPI can only interrupt a CPU with irqs disabled if the IPI is an
NMI. I haven't looked before to see if we use NMI IPIs to corral the
other CPUs on panic. On x86, I grepped my way down to
native_stop_other_cpus(), which looks like it does a normal IPI, waits
1 second, then does an NMI IPI. So, if a secondary CPU has the lock
held, on x86 it has roughly 1s to finish what it's doing and re-enable
interrupts before smp_send_stop() brings the NMI hammer down. I think
this should be more than enough time for the secondary CPU to get out
and release the lock.

So then it makes sense to me that you're fixing cases where we
panicked with the lock held, or hung with the lock held. Given the 1
second grace period x86 gives us, I'm on board, as that helps mitigate
the risk that we bailed out early with the try and should have spun a
bit longer instead. Thanks.
