My idea is to clear vdso_base if at least part of the vdso is unmap.
But since some part of the vdso may have been moved and unmapped later,
to be complete, the patch has to handle partial mremap() of the vDSO
too. Otherwise such a scenario will not be detected:

	new_area = mremap(vdso_base + page_size, ....);
	munmap(new_area,...);

You're right, CRIU has to move the vDSO to the same address it has at
checkpoint time.

I'd try to address the perfect job, this may complexify the patch,
especially because the vdso's size is not recorded in the PowerPC
mm_context structure. Not sure it is a good idea to extend that structure..

Thanks,
