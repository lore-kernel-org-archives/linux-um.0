Greg, Kay,

>> Is that a problem for UML somehow?

The login on ttyX takes 30+ seconds.
This very ugly and mostly wrong hack makes the login fast again:
mount -o bind /sys/class/tty/console/ /sys/class/tty/tty0/

/sys/class/tty/console/active exists and contains "tty0"...

Any x86 distribution works fine in UML.
If this will be no longer true due to systemd then better no systemd de=

ever crosses my way. ;-)

Yeah, would make sense.
Many systems don't have CONFIG_VT set.

One good thing is that systemd seems to uncover a nasty bug in UML's
console driver.
A login on tty0 crashes UML.

UML's console driver (arch/um/drivers/line.c) implements tty_operations=
=2E
The crash happens because the tty subsystem calls the driver's close()
function and later
write_room() or chars_in_buffer().

write_room() and chars_in_buffer() fail badly because close() already
cleaned up the driver's private data...

Greg, is UML's assumption wrong that after closing the tty no call to
write_room() or chars_in_buffer() can happen?
I have no idea why systemd is able to trigger this, UML's console
driver is old and has always worked quite well.
