Merge arch/um/Kconfig.char and arch/um/Kconfig.net into a new
arch/um/drivers/Kconfig.  This fits the way Kconfig files are placed
elsewhere in the kernel tree.

-          The User-Mode Linux environment allows you to create virtual serial

-          ttys or ptys.

-          This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial

-          and there is never any data to be read.
-
-config PORT_CHAN

-	help
-          This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial
-          lines to host portals.  They may be accessed with 'telnet <host>
-          <port number>'.  Any number of consoles and serial lines may be

-          It is safe to say 'Y' here.

-          This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial

-          pseudo-terminals (/dev/pty*) and pts pseudo-terminals are controlled
-          with this option.  The assignment of UML devices to host devices
-          will be announced in the kernel message log.
-          It is safe to say 'Y' here.

-          This option enables support for attaching UML consoles and serial

-          (/dev/tty*) and the slave side of pseudo-terminals (/dev/ttyp* and
