Yeah: I think the documentation could do with some improvements on
these fronts: there are a few places which imply that KUnit requires
UML, which is definitely not the case. We still want to encourage
people to try UML: it's usually the quickest way of running tests, but
KUnit itself should remain architecture-independent, as should as many
tests as possible.

I think there are probably (at least) two different things that need
doing to make these sorts of miscommunications less likely. The bulk
of the documentation needs to stop referring to KUnit as something
built upon or using UML (while still making it clear that some of our
tooling defaults to or requires UML at the moment). This shows up in a
lot of the "What is KUnit/Why use KUnit" sections in both the kernel
docs and the KUnit website.

Secondly, we need to document the test environment (possibly alongside
some test style best practises, possibly separately). Given that work
like the debugfs stuff and how to support tests which need __init data
or need to only run once is still ongoing, I'm not sure if we can
definitively state what the solutions there will be yet, but noting
that tests should not depend on a specific architecture like UML
(unless they're testing architecture-specific code in a way that can't
reasonably be made architecture independent) is worth doing sooner
rather than later.

I'll see if I can put a few doc patches together to update/fix at
least some of the most egregious examples.

Cheers,
-- David
