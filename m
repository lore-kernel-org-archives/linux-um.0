There is a reason why ioremap and the associated functions make no
sense on UML, and it remains important to not provide them here
so we can find drivers that accidentally use them and are missing
a dependency on HAS_IOMEM.

No. It's a set of examples for the architectures to look at and
include if they want to.

The important distinction is between drivers we want to enable in
COMPILE_TEST because they are written in a portable way but are just
useless if you don't have the hardware, and other drivers that rely
on an interface and that should not be built when that interface
is not available.
