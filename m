I agree at that level - and the good thing is that there are a lot to learn 
from looking at other people's ways - but working towards unification rather than even
more similar, but subtly different ways I think is a good thing anyway!

I might not see the full picture here wrt file system testing, 
but I do know exactly how difficult it is to do it for that ~29,000 
lines of code Infiniband driver I was working on, since actually I did it
with several versions of the kernel. Anyway that's probably more of a 
topic for a talk than an email thread :-)

I completely agree on that one. I think a fundamental feature of any 
framework at this level is that it should be usable as developer tests as part
of an efficient work cycle.

This is exactly the way we work with KTF as well: 
Change the kernel module under test, and/or the test code, 
compile, unload/load modules and run the tests again, all within seconds.
The overhead of rebooting one or more VMs (network tests sometimes 
require more than one node) or even a physical system, 
if the issue cannot be reproduced without running non-virtualized, 
would only be necessary if the test causes an oops or other crash 
that prevents the unload/load path.

My experience is that unless one can enforce tests to be run on 
everyone else's changes as well, one often ends up having to pursue the bugs 
introduced by others but caught by the tests, so I believe automation and 
unit/low level testing really should go hand in hand. This is the reason for 
the emphasis on automation in the KTF docs, but the primary driver for me has 
always been as a developer toolkit.

As you alluded to above, the development cycle time is really the crucial 
thing here - if what you get has more value to you, then you'd be willing 
to wait just a few more seconds for it. And IMHO the real interesting notion of 
time is the time from saving the changes until you can verify that 
the test either passes, or even more important: Why it failed..

I definitely pragmatically prefer evolution over revolution myself, 
no doubt about that, and I definitely appreciate this detailed view seen from the 
filesystem side,

Thanks!
