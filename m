Yep, that's exactly right!

The test and the code under test are linked together in the same
binary and are compiled under Kbuild. Right now I am linking
everything into a UML kernel, but I would ultimately like to make
tests compile into completely independent test binaries. So each test
file would get compiled into its own test binary and would link
against only the code needed to run the test, but we are a bit of a
ways off from that.

For now, tests compile as part of a UML kernel and a test script boots
the UML kernel, tests run as part of the boot process, and the script
extracts test results and reports them.

I intentionally made it so the KUnit test libraries could be
relatively easily ported to other architectures, but in the long term,
tests that depend on being built into a real kernel that boots on real
hardware would be a lot more difficult to maintain and we would never
be able to provide the kind of resources and infrastructure as we
could for tests that run as normal user space binaries.

Does that answer your question?

Nope, no special instrumentation. As long as the code under tests can
be compiled under COMPILE_TEST for the host architecture, you should
be able to use KUnit.

Tests are in the same directory as the code under test. For example,
if I have a driver drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-aspeed.c, I would write a
test drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-aspeed-test.c (that's my opinion anyway).

Unit tests should be the responsibility of the person who is
responsible for the code. So one way to do this would be that unit
tests should be the responsibility of the maintainer who would in turn
require that new tests are written for any new code added, and that
all tests should pass for every patch sent for review.

A well written unit test tests public interfaces (by public I just
mean functions exported outside of a .c file, so non-static functions
and functions which are shared as a member of a struct) so a unit test
should change at a slower rate than the code under test, but you would
likely have to change the test anytime the public interface changes
(intended behavior changes, function signature changes, new public
feature added, etc). More succinctly, if the contract that your code
provide changes your test should probably change, if the contract
doesn't change, your test probably shouldn't change. Does that make
sense?

So a couple things, in order to write a unit test, the person who
writes the test must understand what the code they are testing is
supposed to do. To some extent that will probably require someone with
some expertise to ensure that the test makes sense, and indeed a
change that breaks a test should be accompanied by a update to the
test.

On the other hand, I think understanding what pre-existing code does
and is supposed to do is much easier than writing new code from
scratch, and probably doesn't require too much expertise. I actually
did a bit of an experiment internally on this: I had some people with
no prior knowledge of the kernel write some tests for existing kernel
code and they were able to do it with only minimal guidance. I was so
happy with the result that I was already thinking that it might have
some potential for onboarding newcomers.

Now, how much burden does this add to maintainers? As someone who
pretty regularly reviews code that come in with unit tests and code
that comes in without unit tests. I find it much easier to review code
that comes in with unit tests. I would actually say that from the
standpoint of being an owner of a code base, unit tests actually
reduce the amount of work I have to do overall. Code with unit tests
is usually cleaner, the tests tell me exactly what the code is
supposed to do, and I can run the tests (or ideally have an automated
service run the tests) that tell me that the code actually does what
the tests say it should. Even when it comes to writing code I find
that writing code with unit tests ends up saving me time overall.
