Sure

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/linux-next.git/log/?h=20170620-linker-tables-v8

I had dropped this long ago mostly due to the fact that my use case
(removal of dead code) was more long term, and not immediate so the
use case wasn't there yet.

I have been meaning to pick this work up again.

For built-in code it would be up to it to manage that. The linker table
stuff would just allow a way for you to systematically aggregate
data into an ELF section in a generic way. It does have a built in
light weight sort mechanism, if you opt out of that and say wanted
to do your own order it'd be up to how you program it in on the data
structure and dispatching after that.

If and when we get to that point we can deal with it then. My instincts
tell me that for early init code we should probably be specially crafted
tests and have they should have their own hand crafted dispatchers.
