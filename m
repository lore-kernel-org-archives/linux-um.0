I'm curious to know what happened. To me it looks like it would be
possible to do it in here:

        system_state = SYSTEM_RUNNING;
        numa_default_policy();

        rcu_end_inkernel_boot();

        do_sysctl_args();

	put it here?

        if (ramdisk_execute_command) {
                ret = run_init_process(ramdisk_execute_command);

That should be before anything happens with an initramfs. (i.e. boot the
kernel without an initrd and it won't be required...)

Later is better! :)

Cool; I'll look for it.
