The root cause of the problem is COMPILE_TEST. People who use it need to
get forced to think about the consequences.
COMPILE_TEST means that the driver will also be build on not so fancy archs
like UML, s390 and m68k where you don't have IOMEM or also DMA in every
possible configuration.
So a quick build test on x86 is not sufficient.

This is why I'm absolutely not a fan of having stubs for iounmap() an friends
for UML. It only tries to bypass the root cause.
What is next? Stubs for DMA? PCI? For everything else that does not build?

With COMPILE_TEST we have created a monster and now we have to deal with it in terms of
having correct dependencies when COMPILE_TEST is being used.
