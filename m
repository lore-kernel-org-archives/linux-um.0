That's a good option, but it may be hard to achieve in the case the vDSO
area has been splitted in multiple pieces.

Not sure there is a right way to handle that, here this is a best
effort, allowing a process to unmap its vDSO and having the sigreturn
call done through the stack area (it has to make it executable).

Anyway I'll dig into that, assuming that the vdso_base pointer should be
clear if a part of the vDSO is moved or unmapped. The patch will be
larger since I'll have to get the vDSO size which is private to the
vdso.c file.

Yes, mprotect() the vDSO is allowed on PowerPC, as it is on x86, and
certainly all the other architectures.
Furthermore, if it is done on a partial part of the vDSO it is splitting
the vma...
