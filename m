Adding one more thought here so I don't forget it before the topic picks
up again in the KTAP version 2 world...

The test parser could generate an artificial subtest test case status line
or normal test case status line to report the result of the EXPECT.  This
also is ugly because it is creating a new requirement on the parser vs the
expectations in the KTAP plan line (the plan line could include the EXPECT
in the number of tests count, but then the raw KTAP test output would be
missing the artificial EXPECT test result).  No need to hash out details
here, just a thought...
