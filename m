Christoph should just fold it in, the bug only exists after his
change to it.

64 is most likely just fine. Some drivers rely on having 1 in flight and
it's easier to manage to just let blk-mq take care of that. Outside of that,
there aren't any magic values. We should probably just use BLKDEV_MAX_RQ
for ones that don't have a specific hw limit or need.
