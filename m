Yes, I totally agree with that.  If there is a reasonable way to
implement.  But in the DT unittest world, I have not found a
reasonable way.  Adding hooks is suggested below, but for DT
unittest _I_ (opinion) do not find that reasonable.  I voice no
vote for kunit - that decision is up to the kunit crowd.

I'm not a fan of hooks.  I see them as a maintenance burden, dependent
upon the source version of the object being tested, yet another
thing that can go wrong, and adds complexity to creating a test
environment and running the test.  Again, this just a personal
opinion, and I'm not voting for or against this for kunit.

Isn't this just another hook?  So same opinion.

Again, don't let my opinion affect the voting between 1, 2, 3, or other
for kunit.

I don't understand "dependent on the exact layout of the tests".
If you are saying that the test result parser has to figure out
which test result to override, that has not been an issue in
the cases that I use EXPECTs in DT unittest.  The EXPECT begin and
EXPECT end have always immediately surrounded a single test, so
when the parser processes the EXPECT end, only the most recent
test result could be overridden.  This has worked because the
kernel warning and error messages have been from kernel action
that happens synchronously with the test.  If the test prods the
kernel in a way that results in the kernel performing an
asynchronous activity (eg in another thread), then it becomes
more complex to structure the EXPECT end -- I would imagine that the
test would have to block on the asynchronous activity just before
reporting the normal KTAP status result for the test (and the
EXPECT end would normally be just after reporting the KTAP
status result for the test).

I agree with overriding being ugly.  For the DT unittest results
parser, the EXPECT summary results are reported separately from
the individual test summary results.  The parser also flags the
EXPECT failure in line with the normal individual test result
lines.

I see both parsing results as valid, and as a policy choice for
each test parser.
