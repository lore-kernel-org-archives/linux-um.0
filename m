Another idea, the issue with COMPILE_TEST is that it is automatically selected
by make targets such as allyesconfig or allmodconfig.
Couldn't we make COMPILE_TEST just harder to select?
i.e. that with allyesconfig it is still disabled and if someone really wants to
do a compile test of anything we could issue something like "make allyesconfig COMPILE_TEST=y"
to have COMPILE_TEST selected?

Thanks,
