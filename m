The page cache is kind of subtle.  The grab_cache_page_write_begin()
will return a Locked page with an increased refcount.  If it's Uptodate,
that's exactly what we want, and we return it.  If we have to read the
page, readpage used to unlock the page before returning, and rather than
re-lock it, we would drop the reference to the page and look it up again.
It's possible that after dropping the lock on that page that the page
was replaced in the page cache and so we'd get a different page.

Anyway, now (unless fscache is involved), v9fs_fid_readpage will return
the page without unlocking it.  So we don't need to do the dance of
dropping the lock, putting the refcount and looking the page back up
again.  We can just return the page.  The VFS doesn't need a special
return code because nothing has changed from the VFS's point of view --
it asked you to get a page and you got the page.
