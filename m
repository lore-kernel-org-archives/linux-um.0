Yeah, this would be a goal.
UML and LKL are quite different but they should share at least their userspace
drivers.
I also don't mind if we don't share every driver at the beginning but
it should be
a feasible goal for the future.

A few months ago I though this is doable but now I'm not so sure anymore.

Agreed. UML can also learn from LKL. :-)
