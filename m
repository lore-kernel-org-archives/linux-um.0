Guilty as charged (I have a long history with C++, sorry). Would you
prefer I changed the name? I just figured that try-catch is a commonly
understood pattern that describes exactly what I am doing.

Ah, yes, Frank (and probably others) previously asked me to remove
unnecessary method pointers; I removed all the totally unused ones. As
for these, I don't use them in this patchset, but I use them in my
patchsets that will follow up this one. These in particular are
present so that they can be mocked out for testing.

These methods are for a UML specific implementation in a follow up
patchset, which is needed for some features like crash recovery, death
tests, and removes dependence on kthreads.

I know this probably sounds like premature complexity. Arguably it is
in hindsight, but I wrote those features before I pulled out these
interfaces (they were actually both originally in this patchset, but I
dropped them to make this patchset easier to review). I can remove
these methods and add them back in when I actually use them in the
follow up patchsets if you prefer.

Thanks!
