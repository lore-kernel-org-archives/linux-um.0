Are you talking about right after we met at LPC in 2017? We talked about
working together, but I thought you didn't really see much value in what
I was doing with KUnit.

Or are you talking about our fist discussion on the RFC[1]. In this
case, you seemed to assert that KTF's approach was fundamentally
different and superior. You also didn't really seem interested in trying
to merge KTF at the time. The discussion concluded with Luis suggesting
that we should just keep working on both separately and let individual
users decide.

What changed since then?

> I still think that's possible.

I hope you aren't asserting that I have been unwilling to work with you.
At the outset (before I sent out the RFC), I was willing to let you take
the lead on things, but you didn't seem very interested in anything that
I brought to the table and most importantly were not interested in
sending out any code for discussion on the mailing lists.

After I started the RFC, most of your comments were very high level and,
at least to me, seemed like pretty fundamental philosophical differences
in our approaches, which is fine! I think Luis recognized that and I
think that is part of why he suggested for us to continue to work on
them separately.

I am not trying to be mean, but I don't really know what you expected me
to do. I don't recall any specific changes you suggested me to make in
my code (I think you only ever made a single comment on a thread on
anything other than the cover letter.) And you never proposed any of
your own code demonstrating an alternative way of doing things.

Nevertheless, you are of course fully welcome to critique anything I
have proposed, or to propose your own way of doing things, but we need
to do so here on the mailing lists.

It's possible. Like I said before, our approaches are pretty
fundamentally different. It sounds like there might be some overlap
between our expectaion/assertion macros, but we probably cannot use the
ones from Googletest without introducing C++ into the kernel which is a
no-no.

I have a lot more features on the way, but what is in this initial
patchset are the absolutely core things needed to produce an MVP, and
yes, most of that code revolves around reporting and the fundamental
structure of tests.

Developing cool features is great, but you need to start off on a basis
that the community will accept. Sometimes you need to play around
downstream a bit to develop your ideas, but you always want to get
upstream feedback as early as possible; it's always possible that
someone might propose something, or point out something that breaks a
fundamental assumption that all your later features depend on.

Yep, I intentionally left an interface so printk (well actually
vprintk_emit) can be swapped out with another mechanism.

Cool. Looking forward to hearing about it.

Cheers!
