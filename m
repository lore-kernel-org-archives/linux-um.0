"If add 'COMPILE_TEST=y' to 'asm-generic', it will provide self checking
services to both modules and architectures"

Is it correct ?

For developers, they may has hobby to let their code pass compiling as
much as possible in the integrating environments, although the modules
may not really load/run.

Hmm... at least, it is neither architectures issue nor modules issue.

So we have to look for who have duty for it, since it is a 'generic'
issue for many architectures and modules, we have to find it in
'generic' area (e.g. "./include/*").

At least now, it seems only "asm-generic/*" can play the unlucky role !!

Or, do you think it is still the modules issue themselves ?


Thanks.
