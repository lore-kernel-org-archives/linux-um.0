To be clear, the test-framework-tools format we are talking about is
TAP13[1], correct?

My understanding is that is what kselftest is being converted to use.

They are still optional.

That's a good point. A couple things,

First off, supporting TAP13, either in the kernel or the wrapper
script is not hard, but I don't think that is the real issue that you
raise.

If your only concern is that you will always be able to have human
readable KUnit results printed to the kernel log, that is a guarantee
I feel comfortable making. Beyond that, I think it is going to take a
long while before I would feel comfortable guaranteeing anything about
how will KUnit work, what kind of data it will want to expose, and how
it will be organized. I think the wrapper script provides a nice
facade that I can maintain, can mediate between the implementation
details and the user, and can mediate between the implementation
details and other pieces of software that might want to consume
results.
