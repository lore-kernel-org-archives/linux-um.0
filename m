Hmm, perhaps it indeed can't happen.

COMPILE_TEST is meant to enable drivers that are not useful, due to missing
infrastructure.
Without having it enabled, you don't want to include useless drivers.
If you have dummies, you still want the HAS_IOMEM dependency to avoid
compiling useless drivers. I.e. it's a hint for distros, who don't want to ship
useless drivers.
