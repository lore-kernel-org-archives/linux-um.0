I think that makes sense. Any code that can build should be able to
build under KUnit, but we probably want to turn that on on a per
driver basis as we write tests for them.

It almost certainly would fail randconfig. As you point out below, I
don't implement everything that's required, just enough to show off
KUnit in a couple examples.

Those need to be done too. I just mostly wanted to illustrate that it
can be done, and what is needed to support mocking MMIO. I wasn't sure
how controversial my approach would be, so I didn't want to put any
more work than was necessary for illustration without getting some
feedback.

I think that's reasonable.

Almost definitely. I figured this patchset, as is, is a good
illustration of what I am trying to do, what is possible, and the kind
of work that is necessary to get there. If people like what I am doing
and want more of this type of thing, I think focussing on getting base
support in and then working on features separately is the way to go.

At first glance, just you probably only need the stuff in the first 9
patches for that. You don't appear to be doing any IO of any sort, so
you don't need this stuff. You appear to depend only on some fake
data; everything else seems pretty self contained, so you don't need
any of the mocking support for that. So if I understand correctly you
just need the base support needed for bare bones unit tests, all that
stuff is in the first 9 patches.

Cheers
