I thought about this, but how could you even get to the point of
having some physical address passed to the driver? Perhaps some old
ISA driver, but I'm not sure memory ranges were ever fixed (only i/o).
We're really only talking about UML here.

It can be done though, it's just more ifdef'ery.

Why? Most are either HAS_IOMEM or HAS_IOMEM && COMPILE_TEST.
