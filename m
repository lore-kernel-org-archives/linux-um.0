Agreed!

Also... selftests are an example of tests which *are* upstream and yet
there are teams out there using them to test these tests on older
kernels. So the scripts for instance are supposed to work with older
kernels. So if you expand on a feature your selftest script should
detect if the new mechanism is present or not, and also be backward
compatible with older kernels.

Agreed!

Also, I actually see no issue with having *both* kunit / ktest merged
upstream. IMHO we should not be forcing people to pick one or the other
but rather we should: let the best test framework win. Similar as we
did with LSMs. Each test framework has its own gains / advantages.
