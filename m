"substitutes" are just an artifact from having to group together all
suites that occur in a module. It should be mostly immaterial to most
users, but we have to have all the suites that occur in a module
grouped together in order to support KUnit tests as loadable modules.

I just call them subsuites here because I didn't know what else to
call them. Still, the relationship between them should be mostly
ignored by users as you seem to recognize below.

Also, module support for KUnit was just recently accepted into torvalds/master:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=08a3ef8f6b0b1341c670caba35f782c9a452d488

You should be able to apply this change to torvalds/master now.

Nope, but I think you understand correctly below...

Yep! You got it! Test cases are "subtests" in TAP 14. So there is a
ok/not ok line for each suite, and nested as subtests above that are
indented ok/not ok lines for each test case. KUnit already does this
today. We are just moving some of the printing logic out so we can
count the suites and print a test plan.

Technically, what we print today (before this change) is legal TAP 14.
The test plan is not required. However, the test plan is very helpful
as it makes it possible to know if some tests just never ran for some
reason.

I just applied this patch series against torvalds/master which I
pulled this morning, and it applied cleanly. I will specify in any
subsequent revisions that this is based on linux-kselftest/kunit since
that's where these patches will be applied, but they should apply
against any rc of 5.6 just fine once they are cut.

Cheers!
