This already exists in include/asm-generic/uaccess.h, but that file is
currently not as easy to use as it should be. I've previously looked into
what it would take to get more architectures to use common code
in that file, but I currently have no plans to work on that.

Same here: architectures can already provide a __put_user_fn()
and __get_user_fn(), to get the generic versions of the interface,
but few architectures use that. You can actually get all the interfaces
by just providing raw_copy_from_user() and raw_copy_to_user(),
but the get_user/put_user versions you get from that are fairly
inefficient.

In my opinion, the biggest win would be to move the type-agnostic part of
get_user/put_user into completely generic code, this is what architectures
get wrong the most, see patch 02/18 in this series for instance.

What I'd like to see is that architectures only provide fixed-length
versions of unsafe_get_user()/unsafe_put_user(), with the type-agnostic
versions (get_user(), __get_user(), unsafe_get_user() and their put
versions) all defined once in include/linux/uaccess.h based on those.

I tried implementing this in the past, but unfortunately the resulting
object code from my generalized implementation was worse than
what we have today, so I did not continue that work.
