The approach seems sensible to me given that it separates from a
semantics perspective kernel subsystem init work from *testing*, and
so we are sure we'd run the *test* stuff *after* all subsystem init
stuff.

Dispatching, however is still immediate, and with a bit of work, this
dispatcher could be configurable to run at an arbirary time after boot.
If there are not immediate use cases for that though, then I suppose
this is not a requirement for the dispatcher. But since there exists
another modular test framework with its own dispatcher and it seems the
goal is to merge the work long term, this might preempt the requirement
to define how and when we can dispatch tests post boot.

And, if we're going to do that, I can suggest that a data structure
instead of just a function init call be used to describe tests to be
placed into an ELF section. With my linker table work this would be
easy, I define section ranges for code describing only executable
routines, but it defines linker tables for when a component in the
kernel would define a data structure, part of which can be a callback.
Such data structure stuffed into an ELF section could allow dynamic
configuration of the dipsatching, even post boot.

I think this is a good stepping stone forward then, and to allow
dynamic configuration of the dispatcher could mean eventual extensions
to kunit's init stuff to stuff init calls into a data structure which
can then allow configuration of the dispatching. One benefit that the
linker table work *may* be able to help here with is that it allows
an easy way to create kunit specific ordering, at linker time.
There is also an example of addressing / generalizing dynamic / run time
changes of ordering, by using the x86 IOMMU initialization as an
example case. We don't have an easy way to do this today, but if kunit
could benefit from such framework, it'd be another use case for
the linker table work. That is, the ability to easilly allow
dynamically modifying run time ordering of code through ELF sections.

Indeed, the concern is just a real semantics limitations. With the tests
*always* running after all subsystem init stuff, we know we'd have a
real full kernel ready.

It does beg the question if this means kunit is happy to not be a tool
to test pre basic setup stuff (terminology used in init.c, meaning prior
to running all init levels). I suspect this is the case.

Modules just have their own sections too. That's all. So it'd be a
matter of extending the linker script for modules too. But a module's
init is different than the core kernel's for vmlinux.
