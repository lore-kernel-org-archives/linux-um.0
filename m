To me, it's a weak correlation between having a kmsg dumper, and
wanting or not wanting the info level output to come before kdump.
Hyper-V is one of only a few places that register a kmsg dumper, so most
Linux instances outside of Hyper-V guest (and PowerPC systems?) will have
the info level output after kdump.  It seems like anyone who cared strongly
about the info level output would set the panic_notifier_level to 1 or to 3
so that the result is more deterministic.  But that's just my opinion, and
it's probably an opinion that is not as well informed on the topic as some
others in the discussion. So keeping things as in your patch set is not a
show-stopper for me.

However, I would request a clarification in the documentation.   The
panic_notifier_level affects not only the hypervisor, informational,
and pre_reboot lists, but it also affects panic_print_sys_info() and
kmsg_dump().  Specifically, at level 1, panic_print_sys_info() and
kmsg_dump() will not be run before kdump.  At level 3, they will
always be run before kdump.  Your documentation above mentions
"informational lists" (plural), which I take to vaguely include
kmsg_dump() and panic_print_sys_info(), but being explicit about
the effect would be better.
