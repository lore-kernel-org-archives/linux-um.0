	Update pushed; x86-specific stuff moved to arch/x86/um, more things
merged/cleaned up.  Works here, both for 32bit and 64bit builds...  At least
as well as the mainline one does, that is - there still are two very annoying
issues, shared with mainline at least as far back as 2.6.36:
	* dancing close to OOM sometimes ends up with reserved pages showing
up in pagetables.  Code in mm/* is Not Happy(tm)...
	* tty-on-xterm sometimes crashes on the first keysyms reaching it;
as far as I can tell, it's something related to SIGWINCH handling - whether
it happens or not depends on the way xterm windows are laid out and flipping
between them first seems to prevent that shit.  If it hasn't happened at once,
it won't happen at all...  Something in drivers/chan or drivers/line, most
likely...

	I can post the damn thing as patch series, but it's about 380Mb
even with git format-patch -M and 78-posting mailbomb is a bit over the top
anyway...
