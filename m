Let's talk about current state. Right now kunit is in linux-next and
we want to add a few more tests. We will have to coordinate the effort.
Once kunit get into mainline, then the need for this coordination goes
down.

Let's focus on the next few weeks first so we can get this into mainline
in 5.5.

The two of us can chat next week and come up with a plan.
