This (old) paper should help with some of the rationale and design
decision behind LKL:

The host ops part is not properly explained in the paper as it evolved
over time (they are called native operations there), so I will try to
give a high level overview here.

In order to make it easier to compile LKL applications for different
targets (OSes, architectures, user/kernel) we decided to use a two
step build process: a kernel build and a host target (+apps) build.
This helped us reduce intrusions in the kernel build system while
allowing to support the various requirements a host target has. As
part of the first step a lkl.o object and a set of processed kernel
uabi headers (to avoid conflicts with host Linux kernel headers) are
generated. These are then use to build a library (liblkl.so) for a
specific target. Here is where host ops are compiled in together with
the lkl.o object. This is the reason for the split between arch/lkl
(kernel) and tools/lkl (host target).

I think this build split is the biggest challenge in integrating LKL
with UML and I think once this is resolved it will be much easier to
merge the rest.

I am curios to learn what you think about such a split build for UML
and if there are any low hanging fruits we could start from.

Thanks,
Tavi
