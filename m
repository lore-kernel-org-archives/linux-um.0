Yep, I have some patches that address this, but I thought this is
sufficient for the initial patchset (I figured that's the type of
thing that people will have opinions about so best to get it out of
the critical path). Do you want me to add those in the next revision?

If you want to eliminate depends, wouldn't it be best to have KUNIT
depend on whatever it needs, and then do `if KUNIT` below that? That
seems cleaner over the long term. Anyway, Kees actually asked me to
change it to the way it is now; I really don't care either way.

I am not entirely opposed. The greater isolation we can achieve, the
fewer dependencies, and barriers to setting up test fixtures the
better. I think the best way to do that in most cases is allowing
minimal test binaries to be built that have the absolute minimum
amount of code necessary to test the desired property. That being
said, integration tests are a thing and drawing a line between them
and unit tests is not always possible, so supporting other
architectures might be necessary.

Fair enough. What specifically are you suggesting should go in
`drivers/platform/uml`? Just the bits that are completely tied to UML
or a concrete architecture?

You are not the first person to ask for this.

For the vast majority of tests, I think we can (and consequently
should) make them run without any external dependencies. Doing so
makes it such that someone can run a test without knowing anything
about it, which allows you to do a lot of things. For one, I, as a
developer, don't have to hunt down somebody's QEMU patches, or
whatever. But it also means I, as someone maintaining part of the
kernel, can make nice test runners and build things like presubmit
servers on top of them.

Nevertheless, I accept that there are things which are just easier to
do with hardware or a VM (for integration tests it is necessary).
Still, I think we need to make sure the vast majority of unit tests do
not depend on real hardware or a VM.
