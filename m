Hmm. But I didn't argue with that? I like the idea of JOBCTL_TASK_FROZEN.

I meant, I do not think that removing KILLABLE from TASK_TRACED (not
from __state) and complicating *signal_wake_up() (I mean, compared
to your previous version) is a good idea.

And. At least in context of this series it is fine if the JOBCTL_TASK_FROZEN
tracee do not block in schedule(), just you need to remove WARN_ON_ONCE()
around wait_task_inactive().

Of course. See above.

Oh, thanks Eric, but I understand this part. But I still can't understand
why is it that critical to block in schedule... OK, I need to think about
it. Lets assume this is really necessary.

Anyway. I'd suggest to not change TASK_TRACED in this series and not
complicate signal_wake_up() more than you did in your previous version:

	static inline void signal_wake_up(struct task_struct *t, bool resume)
	{
		bool wakekill = resume && !(t->jobctl & JOBCTL_DELAY_WAKEKILL);
		signal_wake_up_state(t, wakekill ? TASK_WAKEKILL : 0);
	}

JOBCTL_PTRACE_FROZEN is fine.

ptrace_check_attach() can do

	if (!ret && !ignore_state &&
	    /*
	     * This can only fail if the frozen tracee races with
	     * SIGKILL and enters schedule() with fatal_signal_pending
	     */
	    !wait_task_inactive(child, __TASK_TRACED))
		ret = -ESRCH;

	return ret;


Now. If/when we really need to ensure that the frozen tracee always
blocks and wait_task_inactive() never fails, we can just do

	- add the fatal_signal_pending() check into ptrace_stop()
	  (like this patch does)

	- say, change signal_pending_state:

	static inline int signal_pending_state(unsigned int state, struct task_struct *p)
	{
		if (!(state & (TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE | TASK_WAKEKILL)))
			return 0;
		if (!signal_pending(p))
			return 0;
		if (p->jobctl & JOBCTL_TASK_FROZEN)
			return 0;
		return (state & TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) || __fatal_signal_pending(p);
	}

in a separate patch which should carefully document the need for this
change.

Oh, but this is clear. But do we really care? If the tracer exits
unexpectedly, the tracee can have a lot more problems, I don't think
that this particular one is that important.

Oleg.
