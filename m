Likewise! Unfortunately, I could not make it. So it goes.

I don't see why we cannot just discuss it here as we are already
doing. Besides, you are mostly interested in out of tree testing,
right? I don't see how this precludes anything that you are trying to
do with KTF.

I think the best way to develop something like what I am trying to do
with KUnit is gradually, in tree, and with the active input and
participation of the Linux kernel community.

I am not advocating that we mock everything. Using as much real code
dependencies as possible for code under test is a pretty common
position, and one which I adhere to myself.

Is this new? When I tried your code out, I had to install the kernel
objects into my host kernel. Indeed, your documentation references
having to install kernel modules on the host:

I made it possible to "port" KUnit to other architectures.
Nevertheless, I believe all unit tests should be able to run without
depending on hardware or some special test harness. If I see a unit
test, I should not need to know anything about it just to run it.
Since there is no way to have all possible hardware configurations a
priori, all tests must be able to be run in a place that doesn't
depend in hardware; hence they should all be runnable as just normal
plane old user space programs with no dependency on a host kernel or
host hardware.

I would love to reuse Googletest/Googlemock if it were possible; I
have used it a lot on other projects that I have worked on and think
it is great, but I need something I can check into the Linux kernel;
this requirement rules out Googletest/Googlemock since it depends on
C++. There are existing frameworks for C, true, but we then need to
check that into the Linux kernel or have the kernel depend on that; to
me that seemed like a lot more work than just reimplementing what we
need, which isn't much. Most of the hard parts are specific to the
kernel anyway.

I think you are misunderstand me. By isolation, I just mean no code
under test should depend on anything outside of the control of the
test environment. As I mention above, reusing real code for test
dependencies is highly encouraged.

As for running against hardware, yes, we need tests for that too, but
that falls under integration testing; it is possible to use what I
have here as a basis for that, but for right now, I just want to focus
on the problem of unit testing: I think this patchset is large enough
as it is.

Yep, I totally agree, but this is why I think test isolation is so
important. If one test, or one piece of code is running that doesn't
need to be, it makes debugging tests that much more complicated.

Cheers!
