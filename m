Aha - excellent - I had hoped to grab you at Plumbers to talk about
this, after hearing you mention something at your Xarray talk - but
didn't seem to find a suitable time.

Sounds like we already have a starting point then.

Scheduling finesse aside, This shouldn't be too hard to emulate/wrap
with pthreads?

Fault injection throughout would certainly be a valuable addition to any
unit-testing.

Wrapping tests into a single userspace binary could facilitate further
memory leak checking or other valgrind facilities too.

Wrapping through User-mode linux essentially provides this already
though. In fact I guess that goes for the thread interfaces topic above too.

Thanks for the references - more to investigate.
