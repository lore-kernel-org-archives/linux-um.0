One way out of this would be accept that UML is just too different
from the other architectures, and make COMPILE_TEST itself depend
on !UML.

COMPILE_TEST is highly valuable for me, because it means that all the
ARM specific drivers can now be build-tested on x86 and they show up
for anyone doing allmodconfig builds. If we introduce a regression
in any of the drivers, it gets caught much quicker because many
subsystem maintainers run an x86 allmodconfig build after pulling
downstream maintainer trees. There is also stuff like Coverity that
only ever runs on x86.

It does make sense to have COMPILE_TEST imply that we are able
to build things on all architectures, not just x86 in addition to
the platform a driver is meant for, but the value of compile-testing
a random driver with UML in particular approaches zero, and instead
causes lots of work.
