Kconfig can define the same symbol multiple times, which is really
confusing. I only checked for NO_IOMEM, which s390 no longer defines,
but I have not checked what actually happens in case of two conflicting
definitions, where the one lib/Kconfig defaults to 'y' and the one in
arch/s390 defaults to CONFIG_PCI.
