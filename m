Yeah, that is closer to what the UML specific version does, but that's
a conversation for another time.

Cool. Let's revisit this with the follow-up patchset.

Indirection is a pretty common method to make something mockable or
fakeable. Nevertheless, probably an easier discussion to have once we
have some examples to discuss.

Fair enough. Next patchset will have the remaining unused indirection
you pointed out removed.
