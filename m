They were emitted with the "<x>" string constants.

This is used in the userspace part of UML, which runs as a userspace
application on the host. Hence it cannot include kernel header files
directly.

However, now include/linux/kern_levels.h is fairly self-container, perhaps
we should just include that file directly instead of, and get rid of all
DEFINE_STR() users.
