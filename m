Should this behaviour you mention be handled by the KCONFIG depends flags?

depends on (KUMIT & UML)
or
depends on (KUNIT & !UML)

or such?

An example of which configs you are referring to would help to
understand the issue perhaps.

This might also be a config option added to the tests directly like
COMPILE_TEST perhaps?

(Not sure what that would be called though ... KUNIT_RUNTIME_TEST?)

I think that might be more maintainable as otherwise each new test would
have to modify the {min,def}{config,fragment} ...

Sounds like we agree there :)

Thanks for thinking of me.
I hope I managed to reply in time to help and not hinder your progress.
