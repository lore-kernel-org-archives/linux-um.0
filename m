OK ack I will look for the respin! Thanks for the work on this!

Hopefully the push back is clear in that it's motivated by technical and
architectural concerns, your contributions are all appreciated and thank
you for doing the actual work rather than just talking about nommu, this is
great :)

Oh nice thanks :)

BTW did
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260723093633.140989-12-johannes@sipsolutions.net/
go upstream? Or another UML nommu mode? I've not been keeping track of all
that.
